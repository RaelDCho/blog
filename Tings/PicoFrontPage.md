# PicoCTF 2019
---

Now, I know this event is long, long over and 2019 was like 2000 years ago - at a time before covid - but I just wanted make these writeups for mainly myself and whoever that might stumble upon them because of some university assignment (like me). 

Compared to the other PicoCTF challenge categories, I found that binary exploitation was 10000000 (not in binary teehee) times harder and had an incredibly difficult time getting started. Fortunately for me, I had a good friend that was able to get me started and is probably still teaching me (depending on when you're reading this) to this day.
<!-- (check him out at <a href="https://github.com/seb-sec">seb-sec</a>, he's got loads of cool stuff - including write-ups). -->
However, not everyone is as fortunate to have a friend who is more experienced in this sort of stuff.
I wanted to create an in-depth page on how beginners (like me) can understand and solve these using tools such as gdb and pwntools, rather than for just copy-and-pasting the answers.

So, as I was saying, I'm leaving these for myself as a sort of notebook, and anyone who might want to take a stab at the binary exploit challenges but don't know where to get started. Check out the links below for the challenges!!!
